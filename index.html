George Falconer, played by Firth, is an ­expatriate ­Englishman in Los Angeles, a ­bespectacled college professor teaching English literature.</td>

          <td><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/df/Starship_Troopers_-_movie_poster.jpg" alt="starship Troopers"></td> <td>"Starship Troopers'' is the most violent kiddie movie ever made. I call it a kiddie movie not to be insulting, but to be accurate: Its action, characters and values are pitched at 11-year-old science-fiction fans. That makes it true to its source. It's based on a novel for juveniles by Robert A. Heinlein.</td>

          <td><img src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51V0ZMBPPRL._SY445_.jpg" alt="wings of desire"></td> <td>The angels in “Wings of Desire” are not merely guardian angels, placed on Earth to look after human beings. They are witnesses, and they have been watching for a long time--since the beginning. Standing on a concrete river bank in Berlin, they recall that it took a long time before the primeval river found its bed. They remember the melting of the glaciers. They are a reflection of the solitude of God, who created everything and then had no one to witness what he had done; the role of the angels is to see./td>
